# About

This project is a front-end clone of YouTube, built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual layout of YouTube’s homepage, including the header, sidebar, video thumbnail grid, and responsive design for different screen sizes. It’s an exercise in CSS layout, responsive design using media queries, and practicing clean structure for HTML and CSS files.
